Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code following object-oriented programming principles. 3. Contribute to the creation and maintenance of automated tests to ensure code quality. 4. Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback. 5. Work in an Agile environment, contributing to sprint planning and retrospectives. About you: 1. Basic experience with Python, React, or other relevant technologies, with a willingness to learn and improve. 2. Familiarity with object-oriented programming principles and software design best practices. 3. Understanding of RESTful services and version control systems like Git. 4. A proactive approach to learning, testing, and shipping high-quality code. 5. Strong problem-solving and communication skills with a team-oriented mindset. Perks & Benefits: 1. Comprehensive health insurance covering family members, with 24/7 remote doctor access. 2. Generous PTO (12 paid, 6 sick days) plus holidays and paid parental leave. 3.
